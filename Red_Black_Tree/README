-Makefile:       This file is a standard makefile that creates
                 an executable binary file called Order and WordFrequency
                 and includes a clean utility and a check utility for 
                 memory leaks.


-RB_Tree.h:      This file serves as the header file for the Red Black Tree
                 ADT that was made in Red Black Tree.c as well as containing
                 prototypes for functions that were created in Red Black Tree.c.


-RB_Tree.c:      This file contains a Red Black Tree ADT with its underlying data
                 structure being a Red Black Tree that includes a "cursor"
                 to be used for iteration. The cursor is meant to be used to 
                 traverse through the Red Black Tree by the client in either direction.


-Order.c:        This file contains the top level program for this assignment. Order.c will
                 take in two command line arguments, an input file and an output file. The
                 input file can be any text file and the program will read it, use the
                 Red Black Tree ADT to store the lines of the file into the ADT and print them 
                 out in three different tree walks: PreOrder, InOrder. and PostOrder to the 
                 specified outfile. 
                

-RB_Tree_Test.c: This file serves as the test suite for the red black tree ADT that was made in
                 RB_Tree.c. It contains 15 unit tests that test all the different functions that were
                 implemented in the ADT. The file prints out the test name, whether you passed the specific
                 test, displays your ouput and the expected output if you failed thet test, and then gives you
                 a score of how many test you passed out of 15.
